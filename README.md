# E-Commerce Application Project

This Python script is a simple e-commerce platform built with Python, Flask, SQL, and APIs. 
The app allows admins to add, remove, or update products/customers and view orders. They are then added to a database.

## Features

- Products: Create, read, update, and delete products through the API. Admin users can add new products, retrieve a list of available products, modify product details, and remove products from the inventory.
- Customers: Manage customer accounts by creating, updating, and deleting customer profiles. Customers can register, update their information, and delete their accounts as needed.
- Orders: Process customer orders by creating, updating, and deleting them. Customers can place orders, which admins can update (e.g., mark as shipped) or delete if necessary.
